//my initial concept for the AI from my intelligence report was to use a uniform cost search with iterative deepening
// the cost would be based on a function which takes into account number of nodes, number of singletons, size of large groups etc.
// This may be unfeasible, so I'm going to talk to the prof. and make sure its ok,and try to get a basic idea of how to implement it.
