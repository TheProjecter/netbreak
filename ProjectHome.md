Netbreak is an implementation of the SameGame/Chainshot game written in C# (using Mono).  This is a project for an AI class, so in there will be a heuristic added to play the game intelligently.  I eventually intend to add a gui, and some other nice features.

I decided it'd be nice to share my code, and eventually let people have some fun playing.
